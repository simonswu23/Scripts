## General

### Mechanics
  - Move relearner automatically relearns egg moves
  - Usable held items are no longer permanently consumed after each battle

### Battle
  -  Giga Evolution Changes
    - Requires Giga Band (not MegaZRing) key item, given to player by Crawli after Jynobi Pass battle
    - Giga evolutions now require no held item (Giga stone still required to be in bag)
    - Giga evolutions now double the user's HP, but don't provide additional BST increases (some stat resdistributions)
    - Giga evolutions now do not count as a mega evolution, meaning each team can have both one giga and mega evolution
    - Upon Giga evolving, Giga pokemon may gain a Giga move (from a certain base move)
      - Giga moves break through protect and have 5 pp
    - Giga forms last until the pokemon switches out or faints
    - Giga pokemon cannot be forced to switch
    - TODO: AI Giga evolution targeting still bugged

  - Aqua Ring
    - also cures the user's status at the end of each turn
      
  - Hail
    - grants ice types a x1.5 defense boost
   
  - Misty Terrain
    - grants grounded fairy types a x1.5 special defense boost
      
  - Frostbite
    - halves special attack of afflicted pokemon
    - takes 1/16th of max HP in damage at the end of each turn
    - ice types are immune
      
  - Crests no longer form locked

  - Gravity
    - speed is decreased porportional to how light pokemon are

  - Embargo
    - affects the whole opposing team for five turns (instead of per battler)
  
  - Bug types immune to side effect chances
    - TODO: change this into a password instead

  - Pulse/Aura and Bullet Moves consolidated
    - Bulletproof protects against all moves that Mega Launcher boosts (and vice versa)

  - Terrains (Grassy, Electric, Psychic, Misty) no longer overlap with each other (just like in main series games)

  - Charge now lasts for the entire active duration of the user
